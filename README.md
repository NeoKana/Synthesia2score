# Synthesia to score

## Overview

This repository provides a tool to convert Synthesia-created videos (mp4) into MIDI files. 
Synthesia is a software that allows users to play and learn music by visualizing falling notes. 
With this tool, you can transform these videos into MIDI files, which can then be easily imported into notation software like MuseScore to view sheet music.
